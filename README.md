A fully responsive EXAMPLE Project written in React which dinamicaly displays data about various gym exercises using [ExerciseDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/details) and [MUI](https://mui.com/) for the UI.

## Project status

This project is currently in development. Users can search exercises by name, gym equipment and keyword and see a visual data representation in the form of a GIF. After clicking on one of the GIFs the user is redirected to a details page about the coresponding exercise. Functionality to sort by additional parameters is in progress.
